## PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
>  ### What’s expected for the project :
- Whatever you build should have utility : 
    -   ✅ Use case-wise, The main use for this application is to tract the sentiment of the market based on current trending news . Trend analysis application is one of the best tool beginner traders are looking for  , although sentiment analysis tools are available , it is quite expensive and complicated for beginners and hobbyist . This application will solve the complexity of sentiment analysis by making it as simple as having 3 inputs and a click of a button . 
-  You should have market or real-world research that proves your idea has REAL value to people.
    -   ✅ Stock market is a 34 Trillion Dollar industry, DOW JONES alone has a market cap of 22 Billion Dollars , according to a recent a survey , traditional stocks and options traders would likely use tools which can help facilitate increased profits, however, enterprise software has a steep learning curve that deters beginners and intermediate users alike . What the web-app's vision is to provide an accurate sentiment analysis of a stock at with minimum input . This solves the pain point of traders by having an easy way to analyze the market .  
-  You should perform research on other web / mobile applications in their app’s domain.
    -  ✅ There are a ton of trading bot and sentiment analysis in the market . Stock-Twits is one , although a viable alternative , it pulls data from the users themselves, therefore , it can mudge or manipulate the "sentiment" . Some products charge as much as hundreds of dollars monthly for a trading bot . The best way to approach this problem is by , 1 . Providing a platfrom for traders to create their own algo/sentiment analysis tool , and 2. To create a user friendly UI thus giving traders an easy learning curve in terms of algorithm trading (future app release) .
